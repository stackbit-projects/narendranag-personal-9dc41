  Hello, welcome to my random musings. My name is Naren, I am the CEO and
  co-founder of [Lamin.ar](https://lamin.ar) — the best enterprise
  video-streaming platform in the world built for media companies who want to go
  direct to consumer, and don't want to re-invent the wheel and try and become
  an engineering company.


  I have spent my life at the intersection of art, science and code and am
  passionate about solving problems at world-scale.
